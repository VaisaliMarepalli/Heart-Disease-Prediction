## Heart Disease Prediction
A machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease using medical data and classification algorithms.

#### 📌 Project Overview

This project uses patient medical records to train machine learning models that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. The objective is to assist early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes by leveraging data-driven insights.

#### 📊 Dataset

Source: Heart Disease Dataset

Records: 303 samples

Features: 13 medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.

Target: 0 (No heart disease), 1 (Presence of heart disease)

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

#### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked for missing values and data types

Visualized correlations between features and target variable

Plotted feature distributions and pair plots for insights
